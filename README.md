# Performed following Tasks

üîç Imported the dataset and performed exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset:
1. Data type of all columns in the "customers" table
2. The time range between which the orders were placed
3. Count the Cities & States of customers who ordered during the given period

üîç In-depth Exploration:
1. Growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years?
2. Monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed?
3. During what time of the day, do the Brazilian customers mostly place their orders? (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)
      - 0-6 hrs : Dawn
      - 7-12 hrs : Mornings
      - 13-18 hrs : Afternoon
      - 19-23 hrs : Night

üîç Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:
1. Month on month number of orders placed in each state
2. How are the customers distributed across all the states?

üîç Impact on Economy: 
1. Analyzed the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others
2. Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only)
   (Used the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders)
3. Calculated the Total & Average value of order price for each state
4. Calculated the Total & Average value of order freight for each state

üîç Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time:
1. The no. of days taken to deliver each order from the order‚Äôs purchase date as delivery time
2. Also, calculated the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order
      - (Calculated the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:
        <br/>
            time_to_deliver = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp
            diff_estimated_delivery = order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date)

3. Top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value
4. Top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time
5. Top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery
   (Used the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state)

üîç Analysis based on the payments:
1. Month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types
2. Number of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid
